Juno is an environment for the Julia language, with strong support for interactive development and a whole load of other niceties. It's implemented on top of Light Table, using the [Jewel](http://github.com/one-more-minute/Jewel-LT) plugin and a set of great defaults for Julia development.

Please see [the wiki](https://github.com/one-more-minute/Jupiter-LT/wiki) for installation instructions and documentation.

Note that Juno is halfway through a rename, and used to be called "Jupiter". In general the naming issue is a mess at the moment, so sorry for any confusion this causes.
